As a Product Manager with over six years of experience, I specialize in delivering high-impact digital solutions, including membership portals, Event Management Systems (EMS), and e-commerce platforms. My strong technical background in automation, software testing, and mobile app development allows me to transform complex projects into user-centric products seamlessly.

I excel in Agile environments, aligning development phases with business goals and customer needs. My expertise in Scrum methodologies enables me to break down intricate requirements into actionable deliverables, fostering collaboration and execution.

Transitioning from a Senior Automation QA Lead to Product Manager, I bridge the gap between technical teams and stakeholders, ensuring quality and innovation at every step. Proficient in tools like Jira, Miro, and Google Analytics, I am committed to driving business success through strategic product development.
