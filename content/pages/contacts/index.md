With over 6 years of experience as a Product Manager, I bring a robust technical background to every project. Throughout my career, I have successfully built and launched a variety of digital platforms, including membership portals, Event Management Systems (EMS), and e-commerce solutions. My expertise spans across automation, software testing, and mobile app development, allowing me to handle complex projects with ease.

I am known for delivering complex projects in Agile environments, ensuring that each phase of development is aligned with business goals and customer needs. My experience in automation and software testing has been instrumental in creating high-quality digital solutions.

A significant part of my career has involved managing multi-year product roadmaps, where Iâ€™ve been able to strategically align product development with long-term business objectives. I also have deep expertise in Scrum methodologies, which I use to break down complex business requirements into manageable deliverables, ensuring that teams can execute effectively.
